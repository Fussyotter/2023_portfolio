				Hi, I'm Isaac. I am a software developer living in Los Angeles. I have
				experience working with a variety of programming languages and tools,
				and I am always eager to learn new technologies. On top of software
				development, I have over 8 years of experience in film production and
				supervision, teaching and performing Shakespeare professionally and I'm
				also forklift certified if there are pallets in need of a push. In my
				free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and experimenting with new recipes
				in the kitchen.
