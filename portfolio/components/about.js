			<p>
				I am a software engineer with a passion for complex problems. I have
				experience working with a variety of programming languages and tools,
				and I am always eager to learn new technologies. I have over 8 years of
				experience in freelance film production and supervision as well as
				teaching Shakespeare and driving a forklift. Those two are not related,
				but that would be fun. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and
				experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
