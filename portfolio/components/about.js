			<p>
				I am a software engineer with a passion for complex problems. I have experience working with a variety of
				programming languages and tools, and I am always eager to learn new
				technologies.  I have over 8 years of experience in freelance film production and supervision as well as teaching Shakespeare and driving a forklift.  Those two are not related, but that would be fun.

				In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and experimenting with new
				recipes in the kitchen.
